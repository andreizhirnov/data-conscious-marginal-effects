This repository shows how to use Stata and R code to calculate distribution-weighted average marginal effects (DAME) and make contourplots and heatmaps of marginal effects in non-linear models with interactive codes. The motivation behind these tools is more clearly laid out in the  paper "Taking Distributions Seriously: On the Interpretation of the Estimates of Interactive Nonlinear Models" by Andrei Zhirnov, Mert Moral, and Evgeny Sedashov.
 
- The folder `Stata-code` contains Stata do-files that plot DAME and contour-plots and heatmaps of the marginal effects. These files include instructions for obtaining the datasets they use.
- [using-DAME-on-R-with-annotations](using-DAME-in-R-with-annotations.md) uses the same examples to show how to use the [DAME package in R](https://github.com/andreizhirnov/DAME). The corresponding R Markdown file can be found in `doc-files`.
- [Stata-examples](Stata-examples.md) is the Stata code with more extensive annotatations
