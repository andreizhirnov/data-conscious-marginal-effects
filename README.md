This repository shows how to use Stata and R code to calculate distribution-weighted average marginal effects (DAME) and make contourplots and heatmaps of marginal effects in non-linear models with interactive codes. The motivation behind these tools is more clearly laid out in the  paper "Taking Distributions Seriously: On the Interpretation of the Estimates of Interactive Nonlinear Models" by Andrei Zhirnov, Mert Moral, and Evgeny Sedashov.

- The folder `Stata code` contains Stata do-files that plot DAME and contour-plots and heatmaps of the marginal effects. This code uses the datasets included in the `data` folder and cites the original source of these datafiles.
- [using-DAME-on-R-with-annotations]() shows uses the same examples to show how to use the DAME package in R.
- [Stata-exampels]() is the Stata code with more extensive annotatations
